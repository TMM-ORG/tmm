# **User Interface Design Goals**

*While the initial POC is backend-only, this section outlines goals for the future SaaS product.*

* **Overall UX Vision:** A minimalist, friction-free user experience.  
* **Core Screens:** The future application will consist of a main input screen, a processing/results screen, and a user dashboard.
