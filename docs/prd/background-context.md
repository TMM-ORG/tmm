# **Background Context**

Content creators spend hours manually finding trending stories on platforms like Reddit and then use multiple tools to create short-form "story time" videos. This process is slow, inefficient, and limits their ability to capitalize on fast-moving trends.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating an automated agent that turns a user-provided subreddit into a ready-to-post video, transforming a multi-hour process into a single, automated action.
