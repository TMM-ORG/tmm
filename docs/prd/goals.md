# **Goals**

The primary goal of this initial version is to serve as a **Proof of Concept (POC)**. The objectives are to:

* **Prove Technical Feasibility:** Confirm the agent can reliably generate a complete video from a Reddit post.  
* **Validate Output Quality:** Ensure the generated videos are of a "postable" quality as determined by initial testers.  
* **Gather Qualitative Feedback:** Collect detailed feedback to inform the development of a public-facing SaaS product.
