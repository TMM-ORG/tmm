    notes: 'OAuth2 credentials properly managed via environment variables. No hardcoded secrets. Input sanitization implemented for subreddit names. Authorization headers correctly implemented.'

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling for network failures, invalid inputs, API errors (404, 403, 429). Custom error classes for proper error classification. Graceful degradation.'
